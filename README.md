# Content amplification and creation
This repo is for submitting content for social amplification as well as content creation (i.e. blog, website, social). To get started [submit an issue](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/content/issues/new/choose). 

There are two types of issues you can choose from
- Amplification request (Newsletter & Socials)
- Creation request

**Content Amplification**

Content amplification requests should contain compelling links to content from the community that we should amplify via the .NET Foundation social channels. These can be articles, blog posts, videos on YouTube, social posts, presentations, etc. Any content that we should be promoting. 

**Content Creation**

Content creation requests are requests for guest blog posts writen for the [.NET Foundation blog](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog), videos to host on our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/NETFoundation), or content that should be on our website, www.dotnetfoundation.org. When a creation request is scheduled it will also be amplified on our social channels.  


To request technical content and presentations see the [dotnet-presentations repo](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations).

To submit issues and bugs for the website, see the [marketing repo](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/issues).
